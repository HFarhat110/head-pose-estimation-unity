# Unity-Head-Pose-Example

This is a realtime augmented reality face tracker for Unity. It utilizes a DLL from my [Realtime-Head-Pose-Open-cv](https://github.com/NeuralVFX/realtime-head-pose-open-cv) project to find and estimate the 3d pose of the largest head in frame.

## Notes

- This works best in daylight.

- Too dim of lights, or too much motion blur can degrade the results.

## Code Usage
Usage instructions found here: [user manual page](USAGE.md).
