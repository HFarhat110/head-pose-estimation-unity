# Head-Pose-Estimation-Unity

This is a realtime augmented reality face tracker for Unity. It utilizes a DLL from my [Head-Pose-Estimation-OpenCV](https://github.com/NeuralVFX/head-pose-estimation-opencv) project to find and estimate the 3d pose of the largest head in frame.

## Notes

- This works best in daylight.

- Too dim of lights, or too much motion blur can degrade the results.

## Code Usage
Usage instructions found here: [user manual page](USAGE.md).
